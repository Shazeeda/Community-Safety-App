Security Policy

This application was built with secure, real-world software development in mind — designed to demonstrate fullstack security best practices for both frontend and backend architecture.

-CORS Protection
Enforced via FastAPI CORSMiddleware
Only whitelisted origins (e.g., localhost:3000) are allowed

-Token-Based Authorization (Frontend-Ready)
React sends Bearer tokens from localStorage
Backend supports JWT setup using python-jose

-Input Validation
All data validated with Pydantic models
Blocks malformed or unsafe requests

-Modular Route Security
Routes are cleanly separated
Easy to apply auth rules (e.g., admin-only access)

-Secret Management
.env file stores sensitive data
Git-ignored to prevent leaks (12-factor compliant)

> Security is not a feature — it’s a foundation.
